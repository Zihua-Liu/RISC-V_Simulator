RISC-V Simulator
===
# Introduction
This simulator implement the loading and executing process of an ELF file based on RISC-V ISA. This simulator is developed in C++. First, it will analyze the ELF file, extract messages from ELF headers, program header table and section header table, and load the data segment and the code segment to the virtual memory of the simulator.Then, it will begin to execuate each instruction from the entry of the program called "e_entry"(0x10000) to complete the function of the program. The simulator implement the decoding of the RISC-V instruction set, including basic sets (RV32I and RV64I), and basic extended sets(F set and M set). The instructions will be run on the virtual memory and virtual register files of the simulator. The simulator can complete the execution of program like Quick-Sort, Ackerman Function and Drystone.
